Things to remember:

List Node:
		you have methods like appendNode, findNode, getNode, ect.
		remember to have the correct return types, there are some functions that return the next value 
		so you have to say x = delHeadNode() ect


Ready List:
		pretty self explainatory, have to look at the different parameters to continue
		remember for the get_List, you can return a None value, so in order too watch  out for that do not iterate thoguht it when it gets too much.

PCB: 
		You have a ton of different getters/setter methods, so in order to do this, you have to make sure that 
		you're puttin gin a LIST NODE for some of the ones that require listNODES otherwise you wont be able to iterate though it later on

MAIN:
		Create:
			remember that the create function will create an item and put it onto the linkedlist with the corresponding list and will append it to the child process'
